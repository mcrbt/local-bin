# local-bin

## General

This is a collection of various unrelated `bash` and `perl` scripts.

The scripts had initially been written for *Arch Linux*. Some may not work
out of the box on every machine as some files could reside at different
locations or some software may not be present on the system, at all.
A lot of scripts are wrappers around other Linux command line tools, some
are almost one-liners and only few are a little bit more sophisticated somehow.

All scripts are licensed under the **GNU General Public License**, version 3.

The source code of the scripts can be used as example to write tools working
for specific platforms and/or configurations.

## Installation

First, this repository needs to be cloned to a local directory. Then, scripts
being used may be made executable.

In order to *install* scripts, they may be placed (or linked) under `/usr/bin`,
or `/usr/local/bin`, with their filename extension stripped.

For example, to use the tool `battery.pl`, it can be installed by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin.git
chmod 755 battery.pl
cp $(pwd)/local-bin/battery.pl /usr/local/bin/battery
```

To get the battery status, `battery.pl` can then simply be run as:

```bash
battery
```

Alternatively, a symbolic link to the script may be created, which would
do the same trick:

```bash
ln -sv $(pwd)/local-bin/battery.pl /usr/local/bin/battery
```

## Description

The collection currently contains the following **27 scripts**:

* [**`aphwaddr.sh`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/aphwaddr.sh)
  * print hardware address (i.e. *MAC address*) of the wireless
    access point currently connected to

* [**`battery.pl`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/battery.pl)
  * print capacity (percentage) of one or two installed batteries,
    along with their charging status
  * if more than one battery is installed, a cumulated capacity is calculated
  * the path of the battery system files may be changed accordingly

* [**`cfgsync.sh`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/cfgsync.sh)
  * copy e.g. configuration files of user `root` to all other user's home
    directories
  * configuration directories (e.g. `.config/openbox/`) can be copied recursively
  * intended for single user systems with an additional non-privileged
    user, e.g. to execute riskier tasks
  * allows to only modify the configuration file of user `root`, and afterwards
    "synchronize" with all other user accounts having a home directory under
    `/home/`
  * configuration is to be done within the script using the global constant
    `QUIET` to control *verbosity*, and `SYNC_LIST` for a space (" ")
    separated list of filenames (with or without `/root/` prefix)
  * *alternatively*, files (resp. directories) can be provided via command
    line, each as its own argument (e.g. `$ cfgsync .bashrc .xinitrc`; see
    `$ cfgsync --help` for details)
  * **CAUTION**: the script is intended to
    **override existing configuration files** of local users

* [**`clean.sh`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/clean.sh)
  * clear `bash` command history of current user
  * must be "sourced" in the current terminal: `. clean.sh`

* [**`ddg.sh`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/ddg.sh)
  * open `firefox` and search a pattern with *DuckDuckGo* search engine
    from command line

* [**`dictcc.sh`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/dictcc.sh)
  * translate a pattern on [https://www.dict.cc](https://www.dict.cc)
  * the pattern is supplied as command line arguments and can consist of
    multiple words (i.e. multiple arguments)
  * the web browser may be configured, by altering the variable `BROWSER`
    (defaults to `firefox`)

* [**`dns.sh`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/dns.sh)
  * retrieve IP address for a specific host name and vice versa using
    the `host` tool

* [**`doxystrip.sh`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/doxystrip.sh)
  * strip documentation and comments from a `doxygen` *Doxyfile*
  * a default Doxyfile may be generated by `doxygen` using the command
    `$ doxygen -g`, which contains lots of very useful documentation comments
  * unfortunately, that file is approximately 2500 lines (112 KiB)
  * `doxystrip` removes comments from the Doxyfile, to let it only be
    about 330 lines (12 KiB)

* [**`hex.pl`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/hex.pl)
  * convert between plain ASCII strings, and its hexadecimal ASCII
    representation

* [**`ifinfo.sh`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/ifinfo.sh)
  * extract information about the default network interface and its
    assigned IP addresses

* [**`incorporate.pl`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/incorporate.pl)
  * "incorporate" foreign files into a Linux file system by adapting their names
  * whitespaces and lots of special characters are replaced with underscore
    ("\_"), German umlauts and other graphemes are converted to their ASCII
    representation (e.g. "ä"->"ae", "â"->"a", ...)

* [**`invoke.sh`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/invoke.sh)
  * start any program as background task from command line, with
    definitely no output
  * any arguments are forwarded to the new process
  * most useful for software with graphical user interface, to detach
    the background task from the current shell

* [**`ipinfo.sh`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/ipinfo.sh)
  * print active network interface, private IP address (LAN),
    public IP address (WAN), and Tor exit relay IP address, if any
  * depends on `systemd` init system

* [**`manline.sh`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/manline.sh)

    [https://www.man7.org](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/)

* [**`mirrorgen.sh`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/mirrogen.sh)

  * search for C preprocessor macros or *special function register* declarations
    in the specified (or default) MSP430 header file
  * assumes the *Texas Instruments&reg;* `mspgcc` toolchain
  * default MSP430 include path, as well as default target device (e.g.
    `msp430f5529`) can be configured
  * prints whatever the `grep` command returns, or "nothing found"
  * example usage: `$ msp430macro msp430f5529 UCB0TXBUF`

* [**`pacpurge.sh`**](https://github.com/mcrbt/local-bin/blob/master/bin/pacpurge.sh)

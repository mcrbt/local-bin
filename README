GENERAL:
This is a collection of various unrelated bash (and perl) scripts.

The scripts had initially been written for Arch Linux. Some may not work
"out of the box" on your machine as some files could reside at different
locations or some software may not be present on your system.
A lot of scripts are wrappers around other Linux command line tools, some
are one-liners and only few are a little bit more sophisticated somehow.

Feel free to use the source codes as "example" to write your own tools
working for your configuration!


INSTALLATION:
In order to enhance your daily Linux experience place the scripts under
"/usr/local/bin" and remove the respective file name extention.

For example if you want to use the tool "battery.sh" on your system
you may "install" it using:

    $ cp /home/<user>/Downloads/local-bin/battery.sh /usr/local/bin/battery

To get your battery status you can then simply run:

    $ battery

Alternatively you could create a symbolic link to the script which would
do the same trick:

    $ ln -sv /home/<user>/Downloads/local-bin/battery.sh /usr/local/bin/battery

Of course you will need to make the tools executable first:

    $ chown <user> <script>
    $ chmod 755 <script>

(Substitute "<user>" with your username and "<script>" with the respective
 script you want to set the "execute" flag for. If you did not download the
 scripts to your "Downloads" folder you need to change the path to the scripts,
 as well, obviously.)


DESCRIPTION:
The collection currently contains the following 23 scripts:

* ap.sh
    - start/stop a software access point with "hostapd" and "dhcpd"
    - LICENSE: GPLv3
    - depends on: bash, dhcpd, gawk, grep, hostapd, ip, iptables, iw, netctl,

This is a bundle of various unrelated and eventually useful bash (and perl)
scripts. Most of them are some kind of "quick and dirty" approaches and
are not sophisticated or mature at all. Some will work only for specific
operating systems (as written for Arch Linux) and hardware "out of the box"
and need to be adapted for the appropriate configuration.
Most scripts are just wrappers around other software.


The bundle currently contains the following 14 scripts:

* ap.sh - start/stop a software access point with "hostapd" and "dhcpd"
* blctl.sh - control backlight brightness
* ddg.sh - open "firefox" and search with DuckDuckGo search engine from
    command line
* dns.sh - get IP address for specific host name and vice versa
    using "host" tool
* fdiff.sh - wrapper around "diff" system tool to get more specialized
    output
* hex.pl - convert plain ASCII string to ASCII hexadecimal representation
    and vice versa
* inet.sh - a "netctl" wrapper to start the default or a specified network
    profile
* invoke.sh - start any program (including command line arguments) from
    terminal as background task with definitely no output to STDOUT or
    STDERR
* ipstat.sh - print active network interface, local IP address, public
    IP address, and TOR exit node IP if any
* isgd.sh - command line URL shortener (https://is.gd)
* tinyurl.sh - command line URL shortener (https://tinyurl.com)
* unitconv.sh - unit conversion tool; wrapper around "units"
* userlist.sh - print all users from passwd file
* volctl.sh - volume (speaker/headphone) controller; wrapper around
    "amixer"
* wikipedia.sh - open specific Wikipedia article from command line
    (support for German and English language but easily extendable)
